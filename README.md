# NukeSmallScripts
 Small scripts I create to help in my Nuke ventures
 
 CopyCatCreator.py:
 
 CopyCatCreator.py is the first nuke script that I fully completed. Its purpose is to help the nuke user to create a copycat system for rotoscoping.
 Such as an example from the following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMlt0T-3QRQ
 
 The script should prompt the user with basic questions, it also has basic failsafes in store for non-responses. Not completely "bulletproof" however, I will likely
 make it more "bulletproof" later in hopes of making it more streamlined for general use.
