# NukeSmallScripts
 Small scripts I create to help in my Nuke ventures
 
 CopyCatCreator.py:
 
 CopyCatCreator.py is the first nuke script that I fully completed. Its purpose is to help the nuke user to create a copycat system for rotoscoping.
 Such as an example from the following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMlt0T-3QRQ
 
 The script should prompt the user with basic questions, it also has basic failsafes in store for non-responses.

 QuickNodeOptimization.py:

 This script is an attempt to read through all the nodes in a nuke script and see which one is taking up the most memory. This information would 
 then be displayed in a list so the user can optimize the nuke script. Non-functional as of this time.
